// ============================================================================
// DlssNr_FinishedConsumer.h - who consumes a finished-picture capture.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//   The finished-picture capture interval is armed from the NR evaluation seam.
//   Under XeFG it is consumed by the owned handoff in XeFG_Dx12::Present(), which
//   only runs while XeFG is active and this feature's app-facing proxy is the
//   registered FG swapchain. During the pre-activation warmup (and after a
//   deactivation) captures would be armed with no consumer: their game recordings
//   stay unresolved, the slot stays owned, and the four-slot pool starves -
//   capture-20260926-1255-run-end-pid87148 is exactly that state (four arms before
//   XeFG activated at 12:48:33.11, then 11835 no_current_capture skips / 0 apply).
//
//   The XeFG lifecycle publishes this state (ResetNrHandoff, Activate,
//   Deactivate, swapchain release) so the arm path can refuse that warmup arming.
//   Every other provider - including the generic finished-picture route - stays
//   Generic and is untouched.
//
// CONTRACT
//   C1 Generic      no XeFG-owned handoff is in play; arming proceeds as before.
//   C2 XeFGWaiting  an XeFG app-facing proxy is the route and its owned handoff
//                   does not consume captures yet; arming must be refused.
//   C3 XeFGAvailable the owning XeFG proxy is active; arming proceeds and the
//                   next Present consumes the capture.
//   C4 the state is a single process-wide value: the XeFG feature that owns the
//      registered proxy publishes it, and NR reads it under its own lock.
//   C5 only the registered owner publishes; a nested teardown or an aborted release must
//      not leave the state stuck (XeFG release ordering).
